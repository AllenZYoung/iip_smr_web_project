                    <p>Viewing and interpreting an ancient inscription may seem a daunting task. “Aren’t inscriptions just big boring blocks of stone with letters carved into them?” you may ask. “What if I can’t read ancient Aramaic? What if Greek really is all Greek to me?” Never fear! This glossary has you covered -- even if you have no knowledge of ancient languages or specialized knowledge of the ancient world. </p>
