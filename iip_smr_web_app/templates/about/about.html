                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
		  <br>
		  <p>The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine project seeks to build an internet-accessible database of published inscriptions from Israel/Palestine dated ca. 500 BCE to 614 CE. This timespan roughly corresponds to the Persian, Greek, and Roman periods. Our database will make accessible the approximately 10,000 inscriptions published to date and will include substantial contextual information for these inscriptions, including images and geographic information. We tag our data according to Epidoc conventions and are exploring ways to link the database with other projects such as Pelagios and the EAGLE Network. </p>
                    <p>There are three primary goals for this project:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To make these inscriptions, which have been published in a variety of venues, publicly accessible in a way that would be useful for both scholars and the general public;</li>
                        <li>To create a platform that will allow for deeper machine-automated analysis of our data;</li>
                        <li>To contribute toward creating a wider web ecosystem (Linked Open Data) that will allow for the linking and bundling of data dealing with the ancient world.</li>
                    </ol> 
                    </p>
                   <p>As of August 2017 there are approximately 3,000 inscriptions in the database, with more added regularly. All are encoded using Epidoc guidelines. The inscriptions can be accessed via the “map search” tab at the top of this page. For more information on searching the data, see our “Guide to Searching”.</p>
		    <p>Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine is an ongoing project at Brown University. IIP has been online at its present location since 2002 and was among the first freely-accessible online databases of inscriptions. It has been generously supported by the Center of Digital Scholarship and the Goldhirsh-Yellin Foundation.</p>

                    <h4>Rationale</h4>
                    <p>An “inscription” is writing on durable material (excepting coins). At present, we know of some 10,000 relevant inscriptions corresponding to the rough parameters of this database. These inscriptions are mainly in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin, although inscriptions may feature other languages as well. The inscriptions have been written by Jews, Christians, and traditional Greeks and Romans (i.e., “pagans”). Published hither and yon in small collections or even individually in journal articles, these inscriptions have never been fully collected. To compound the problem, many of the actual stones and mosaics upon which the older publications were made are no longer extant, and scholars have shown that some of the extant inscriptions were previously misread or misinterpreted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past two decades, a project to re-edit these inscriptions and present them in print form, the Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae (CIIP), has been underway. There is currently no plan to allow free access to the data of the CIIP. We have been rebuffed repeatedly in our attempts to find areas in which we might collaborate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Despite hosting some of the same data, the Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine is a fundamentally different project. Following a long epigraphic practice that differentiates between new editions (e.g., CIIP) and collections of previously published inscriptions, we seek to gather inscription data into a single digital repository which will increase access to these important materials and make them more useful to scholars and the general public by virtue of their digital existence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The CIIP editors have asked us not to use their work or provide their corpus numbers in our own database. While we do not believe that they have the right to prevent this, we are presently honoring their requests out of a sense of scholarly collegiality.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>
                        The project began in 1996 at the Institute for Advanced Digital Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia as a prototype under the name "Inscriptions of the Land of Israel." This prototype has since been decommissioned. We originally designed a structure for our data in Standard General Markup Language (SGML). Much of this structure underlies the present Epidoc standard (in XML) which we and many other digital inscription projects now share.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project moved to Brown University in 2002, and soon went into production under the auspices of the Scholarly Technology Group, now reorganized as the Center for Digital Scholarship, a unit of the Brown University Library.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Data</h4>
                    <p>
                       The texts are extensively marked up when added to the database. We are using the Epidoc schema and Guidelines to mark up our inscriptions. Please consult our Documentation page for more information about our data encoding and preservation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Our data are freely available for viewing and download. Data can be accessed directly through our API (see our API page for more information) and found on our Github repository.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Technical Information</h4>
                    <p>
                        We enter each inscription as a separate XML file using standard XML editing software (mainly oXygen XML Editor). The bibliographic references currently reside in a separate database in Zotero (each with its own unique ID) referenced by the inscription XML files. The search platform is Apache Solr; our front end uses Django. All our code is available for free download on Github.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Encoding Conventions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Each inscription receives its own XML file which has the same name as the inscription ID. Our encoding follows the Epidoc Guidelines. The full guidelines can be found at http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Following these guidelines, each inscription file has four major parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Header: This section contains all the metadata, or information about the inscription. This includes, when available, a description of the inscription; the object type and material on which it is written and how it is written; the inscription’s date; its place of discovery and present location; its genre and “religion”; its dimensions; and encoding information and links to images.</li>
                            <li>Diplomatic transcription: This section contains the literal transcription of the writing. Greek and Latin inscriptions were written entirely in uppercase letters and frequently do not have breaks between words. This is a simple copy of what is on the stone, with all of its gaps, damage, etc., indicated.</li>
                            <li>Edited transcription: This is where the editor reconstructs and restores the inscription, as necessary, in its original language. Breaks between words are provided and corrections (to, for example, misspelled words) are made.
                            </li>
                            <li>English translation: We try to provide a translation into English for all inscriptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Given the complexity of the data and the different languages (with Hebrew being read right-to-left), we have created a guide for data entry (to be used with our oXygenXML framework - see below) located here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The transcriptions of the inscriptions in their original languages follow the Leiden conventions. These conventions standardize the symbols and punctuation used to represent the text. For example, text inside brackets encloses text which an editor assumes was on the stone. Text inside parentheses are editorial additions, such as the expansion of an abbreviation. The list of Leiden conventions, with their equivalent encoding (which is derived from the TEI, or Textual Encoding Initiative), can be found here.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Vocabularies and Linked Data</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to facilitate searching, we have standardized some of the vocabularies. In particular, the entries for language; type of inscription; physical type; and religion have controlled vocabularies. We are working on standardizing the “figures” as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A note on the use of a category called “religion”. Inscriptions, of course, do not have “religions,” although those who commission them, those who are mentioned in them, and those who carved them might. Moreover, we have a problem categorizing those who are sometimes referred to as “pagan”; this is a pejorative term used by Jews and Christians which lumps together a large set of diverse beliefs and devotional practices. We use the category of “religion” with ambivalence because it is familiar and can be useful to scholars: we attribute a “religion” to inscriptions which have familiar religious symbols or other indications of belonging to such a community. Instead of attempting to create a taxonomy of different Greek and Roman religious groups we lump those together as “Other.” This is an imperfect solution and we would welcome other ideas for categorization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our data contain information that facilitates linking. Primarily:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Geographical linking through the Pleiades project. All inscriptions have Pleiades IDs for their location and can be linked to all other data with the same geographic ID.</li>
                            <li>Object linking through the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus. All objects, such as an altar or a mosaic, contain a unique identifier. This too allows for links across the web to similarly tagged objects.</li>
                            <li>Period linking through PeriodO. We are in the process of contributing additional periodizations to the PeriodO project and will soon add the resulting new identifiers to our data. This will allow consolidation of all data from across the web based on chronological period.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Entering Data</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our encoders use the program oXygen XML for data entry. Note that at this time we prefer version 16 due to its ability to handle the Hebrew and Aramaic. After installing the program on their own machines, our encoders configure it to work with our own custom designed framework. Instructions for installation can be found here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The guide for entering inscriptions is here. Since entering and encoding Hebrew and Aramaic present a distinct set of challenges, those sections might be of particular interest.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Bibliography</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following practices described in the Epidoc Guidelines, IIP has been maintaining bibliographic entries in a master bibliography and referring to these from individually encoded inscriptions. We feel that bibliographic data entry and editing must be collaborative, web based, and unambiguous. In an earlier stage of the project, we managed the bibliography with a customized SQL database which provided useful features such as controlled lists of journal abbreviations. When the project upgraded in 2013, we decided to replace the custom bibliographic database with Zotero. Zotero does not require maintenance on our part and has a versatile API which allows us to access citations directly when displaying an inscription in our interface. IIP assigns ID numbers to bibliographic entries, following the form [IIP-000], and uses the ID to reference a citation. Zotero also assigns ID numbers to bibliographic entries. These are automatic and function as database keys but are not part of the citation data. Thus, we store the IIP ID in the Zotero "Loc in Archive" or “Extra” field, on the premise that it is our project catalog number. To enable the Zotero API to retrieve a particular citation, we also save the IIP ID as a Zotero tag for each entry: the Zotero API can only access tags and a restricted number of bibliographic fields. We do not convert our bibliography to TEI in order to integrate it into our inscription files. The formatted citations the Zotero API generates using the Citation Style Language (CSL) an open language used by a variety of citation managers, are sufficient. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We feel that our choice of an external database, (particularly Zotero, which is widely used; allows for collaboration; and can host a re-useable, standalone bibliography of sources for inscriptions) is an efficient means of working with different types of material and applying the tools most appropriate for each. In the future, when the IIP corpus is substantially complete, it would be important to incorporate full bibliographic entries as "<"bibl">"s into each encoded inscription for archival purposes.

                    <h4>Data Preservation</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are two main repositories of our data. One lives on the production machine, a server maintained by the Brown University Library. This is the “working” repository accessed through our website. The second repository is on Github and is publicly accessible for download or use. The two repositories are substantially the same, although new inscriptions and corrections are first added to the Github repository, and then periodically synced to the repository on the production machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Brown University Library is committed to archiving and maintaining this data. We will soon add our data to the Brown Digital Repository and design a plan to update it at regular intervals.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Workflow and Organization</h4>
                    <p>
                        Encoders create their files in a shared Dropbox folder. Each encoder has his or her personal subfolder, and within each of those is another sub-folder labeled “Finished”. Encoders add files to their “Finished” sub-folder when they complete their work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Periodically, the Project Manager checks the files in the “Finished” folders. When deemed satisfactory, files migrate to a sub-folder labeled “Finished Inscriptions.” Periodically, the Technical Director uploads these approved files to the Github repository. These are then periodically synced to the repository on the production machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All inscriptions are marked with a status: “Approved,” “To Approve,” or “To Correct.” Inscriptions marked “To Approve” are uploaded to the production machine. The Project Director checks each of these files and either approves the file (at which point a file becomes visible to the public) or marks it “To Correct” if it needs modifications.
                    </p>

                    <h2>APIs</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>An API is an application programming interface. It allows users to query a database in the form of a URL. The URL request retrieves structured data which can be processed, analyzed or displayed according to local needs. For a general introduction to APIs, see the documentation provided by the Digital Public Library of America.</p>
                    <p>
                        The IIP API sends queries to the Solr index powering the IIP search interface. Queries will mostly rely on IIP keywords and metadata and will return IIP metadata and IIP IDs. The Solr documentation provides details on the query syntax.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inscription files themselves can be accessed in their XML form by appending the IIP ID to the URL https://library.brown.edu/cds/projects/iip/view_xml/ . For example, the following URL will link to the XML file of inscription AKLD0012: https://library.brown.edu/cds/projects/iip/view_xml/akld0012/
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The IIP ID takes the form AAAA1111 or AAAA1111A (where A stands for an alphabetic character and 1 stands for a number). Please note that although the URL path may change, the IIP ID will not. API queries can return xml or json formats, depending on the value of the wt flag: wt=xml or wt=json.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Some example queries:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Find the first 100 IIP inscriptions:     
                            http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/iip/?start=0&rows=100&indent=on&wt=json&q=*
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find the first 100 inscriptions that are from the region “Coastal Plain”: http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/iip/?start=0&rows=100&indent=on&wt=json&q=region%3A%22Coastal+Plain%22
                            Note that in this query, the search string "Coastal Plain" is enclosed in double quotes "" but that the URL must be encoded as %22 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Return all the genre attributes:
                            http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/iip/?q=*%3A*&start=0&rows=0&indent=on&facet=on&facet.field=type&wt=json
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Useful facets (keywords):</h4>
                    <p>
                        A guide to the keywords appearing in the metadata fields (e.g. “physical type” or “inscription type”) appears on our Glossary page. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NOTE: We are in the process of improving our Solr index, so the API results may change. Most metadata fields will remain the same, but the results will be more concise and easier to use. Also, please note that bibliographic references draw their information from a Zotero database which can be found here.

                    <p>
                        Over the years we have received generous funding from Brown University, especially through the Office of the Vice President of Research and the Program in Judaic Studies. We also receive technical and other infrastructure support from the Center for Digital Scholarship, a division of the Brown University Library. In the summer of 2017 the Dean of the College funded an Interdisciplinary Team Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award which supported four undergraduate students’ full-time work on the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We currently receive generous funding from the Goldhirsh-Yellin Foundation. We are tremendously grateful for their support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is much that we would still like to do, including: the incorporation of more images; advanced tagging of data content; programming to allow for more analysis and visualization; the development of a portal displaying material culture from the Israel/Palestine region in antiquity; and the mounting of an international conference on the digital use of these inscriptions. For these tasks, though, we require additional funding.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine (IIP) project follows a long tradition of reprinting scholarly editions of epigraphical material with appropriate attributions. Our policy of using copyrighted material does not appreciably differ from that of the Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum and other collections of inscriptions. We use other copyrighted material (e.g., images and maps) only with permissions. We further enhance the value of epigraphical data by correcting obvious mistakes, tagging content, and allowing inscriptions to appear in new and dynamic ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In compiling this collection, we have observed the guidelines of fair use as laid out in Section 107 of the U.S. copyright law. This section stipulates certain restrictions based on the following considerations: 
                        >
                            <li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
                            <li>The nature of the copyrighted work</li>
                            <li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
                            <li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work</li>

                    <p>
                        All sources of inscription data are attributed, and users are urged to consult these original sources and to attribute them appropriately. For a relevant legal argument regarding the copyright of reconstructed ancient texts, see David Nimmer, "Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Authorship and Originality," Houston Law Review 38 (2001).
